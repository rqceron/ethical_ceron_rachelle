# Ethics manifesto 

## My Ethical Principles

_Think of this like your data science ten commandments with respect to ethically using data and data science tools._

1. To avoid projects or use information that would place a minority group at a disadvantage.
2. To always portray what the dataset contains not just what the client wants it to say.
3. Understand the context the data comes from to look out for complications or possible biases it introduces. 
4. If the data is publicized implement methods to keep the data untraceable to a single identity.
5. Speak out about a project that breaks any of these principles. 
6. The customers should know the data that is being collected on them.
7. Create boundaries for data collection .
8. Encourage data subjects to look into the data they provide and what the company is allowed to use.
9. Use the data only for what it was provided for. 
10. Disclose the limitations or defects of the data

## Reading Discussion

[Confusions on Big Ethics](https://www.wired.com/2016/05/scientists-just-confused-ethics-big-data-research/)
- There are few boards that keep data scientists accountable for the actions they take on a subject's information. Therefore it is important for us to put in the work and understand all the implications we can produce in our work. 

[History of Data Engineering](https://groupby1.substack.com/p/data-engineering?s=r)
- Roles and technology are consistently changing we need to be able to keep up with new languages coming out. Our responsibilities can change based of the necessity of the company.

[Facebook Files](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-facebook-files-11631713039)
- We need to look at the projects that we are working and keep our principles strong. We can't expect the company to decide the ethical guidelines since the desire for economic growth impedes their decisions. 

[Start Data Science Company](https://medium.com/@brockferguson/leaving-academia-to-start-a-data-science-company-looking-back-at-our-first-year-33dab049d965)
- We can easily get burnt out in keeping up with projects and what the company needs from us. It is important to keep up a private study of your own to learn technologies that interest you.

[Hidden Biases](https://hbr.org/2013/04/the-hidden-biases-in-big-data)
- Consider what you don't see within the dataset (who would be excluded). "Asking where the data theyâ€™re working with comes from, what methods were used to gather and analyze it, and what cognitive biases they might bring to its interpretation."

[Ethics of Driverless Cars](https://www.bmvi.de/SharedDocs/EN/Documents/G/ethic-commission-report.pdf?__blob=publicationFile)
- Consider the decisions we are asking the algorithm to make. What metrics we are willing to accept when it comes to human life.

[Job Advice](https://towardsdatascience.com/data-science-job-seeking-advice-to-my-younger-self-7be10a601030)
- As you job seek learn not only to answer the questions but also to ask. It should be important to learn more about the company culture as you can during your interviews.
